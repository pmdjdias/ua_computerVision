Lab 11 - Video processing

## Outline
* Optical flow
* Background segmentation
* Object Tracking


## 11.1	Optical Flow
Explore the OpenCV example of Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm. Adapt the referred example to detect moving objects in a static scene, considering also that the camera is fixed. Try also to detect moving objects when the camera is also moving at constant speed.

## Background segmentation
Implement a program to capture video from your digital camera or load a video file and develop an algorithm to perform background/foreground separation. Start with a supervised solution where the user can specify what is the background frame. Then improve your solution to automatically detect the background.

## Object Tracking
Implement a program to capture video from your digital camera or load a video file and explore the OpenCV algorithms to perform object tracking. Consider that the camera and the background is fixed and there is one or more moving object in the scene.
