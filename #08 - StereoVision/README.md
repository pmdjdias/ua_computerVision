## 8.1 - Chessboard calibration
Compile and test the file `chessboard.py` (similar to the one used in the last lecture). This code detects corners in a chessboard pattern using openCV functions and shows the results of the detection for a series of images.

Rename the file (`stereo_exe_1.py` for example) and modify the code to allow for detection of corners in a series of stereo pair images (use the provided right images with name `rightxx.jpg`). 
Fill the necessary matrices with the correct value to calibrate the stereo pair. The objective is to define 3 matrices: `left_corners`, `right_cornes` and `objPoints` with, respectively, 2D pixel coordinates of the corners in the left and right image (2 coordinates per row), 3D point coordinates of the chessboard corner (3 coordinates per row).

## 8.2 - Stereo Calibration
Calibrate the stereo pair using the function [cvStereoCalibrate](http://docs.opencv.org/modules/calib3d/doc/camera_calibration_and_3d_reconstruction.html)

Use the default parameters presented in the documentation for the stereo calibration, except for the last parameter that you should set to `CV_CALIB_SAME_FOCAL_LENGTH`, meaning that the algorithm will consider the same focal length for both camera and that no guess is provided for the other parameters.

After a successful calibration, save the matrices in a npz file using the file storage functions to avoid recalibration of the stereo rig each time.
```html
np.savez("stereoParams.npz",
         intrinsics1=intrinsics1,
         distortion1=distortion1,
         intrinsics2=intrinsics2,
         distortion2=distortion2,
         R=R, T=T, E=E, F=F)
```
Try to repeat the process with the other set of images available.

## Note
 Given the large number of parameters to be evaluated the stereo calibration process might not always give reliable results depending on the images. It is possible to ease the process by calibrating individually each camera (intrinsics and extrinsics parameters) with the function cvCalibrateCamera (see previous lecture) and indicate the stereo calibration algorithm to use these values as guess or as fixed by changing the last parameter of the function (`CV_CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS` or `CV_CALIB_FIX_INTRINSIC`). 

## 8.3 - Lens distortion
In a new file, read the distortion parameters of the cameras (function `np.load`), select a stereo pair of images from the pool of calibration images and show the undistorted images (image with the lens distortion removed) using the function `cvUndistort` to compute the new images.

## 8.4 - Epipolar Lines
Modify the previous example to show only the undistorted images. Add the possibility to select a pixel in each image using the following code to set a callback to be called for handling mouse events.
```html
def mouse_handler(event, x, y, flags, params):
    if event == cv2.EVENT_LBUTTONDOWN:
        print("left click")
```
Do not forget to associate the callback to each window using the following code:
```html
cv2.setMouseCallback("Window", mouse_handler)
```

Start by adding a callback to each window and writing down the coordinates of the selected pixel. Do not forget to add a `cvWaitKey(-1)` at the end of the program.

Use the function `computeCorrespondEpilines` to draw the corresponding epipolar line for each selected point (use `cvLine`). The epipolar line of points in the left image should be drawn in right image and vice versa. To compute the epipolar lines, use the fundamental matrix estimated during the stereo calibration. Note that the function computeCorrespondEpilines returns the 3 coefficients (a,b,c) of the corresponding epipolar line for a given point define as ax+by+c=0.

You may use the following code to access the point coordinates and compute the epiline:
```html
p = np.asarray([x,y])
epilineR = cv2.computeCorrespondEpilines(p.reshape(-1,1,2), 1, F)
epilineR = epilineR.reshape(-1,3)[0]
```
and define random colors:
```html
color = np.random.randint(0, 255, 3).tolist()
```

## 8.5 - Image Rectification
Select a pair of stereo images and use the following OpenCV functions to generate the rectified images (corresponding epipolar lines in the same rows in both images):
	`cvStereoRectify`: this function computes the rotation and projection matrices that transform both camera image plane into the same image plane, and thus with parallel epipolar lines. The size of the output matrices R1, R2, P1, P2 is respectively 3x3 and 3x4.
	`cvinitUndistortRectifyMap`: This function computes the transformation (undistortion and rectification) between the original image and the rectified image. The output arrays mx1 and mx2 are a direct map between the two images, for each pixel in the rectified image, it maps the corresponding pixel in the original image.
	`cvRemap`: apply the transformation between two images using the provided map of x/y coordinates.
The several matrices to be used can be defined as:	
```html
R1 = np.zeros(shape=(3,3))
R2 = np.zeros(shape=(3,3))
P1 = np.zeros(shape=(3,4))
P2 = np.zeros(shape=(3,4))
Q = np.zeros(shape=(4,4))
```

For stereo rectification and remapping you might use the following code:
```html 
cv2.stereoRectify(intrinsics1, distortion1, intrinsics2, distortion2 ,(width, height), R, T, R1, R2, P1, P2, Q, flags=cv2.CALIB_ZERO_DISPARITY, alpha=-1, newImageSize=(0,0))

# Map computation
print("InitUndistortRectifyMap");
map1x, map1y = cv2.initUndistortRectifyMap(intrinsics1, distortion1, R1, P1, (width,height), cv2.CV_32FC1)
map2x, map2y = cv2.initUndistortRectifyMap(intrinsics2, distortion2, R2, P2, (width,height), cv2.CV_32FC1)
```

Visualize the resulting images and draw lines in rows (for example at each 25 pixels) to evaluate visually if corresponding pixels are in corresponding lines.

## Optional
Modify the code to make it interactive as in the Epipolar Line section. By clicking on a point in an image, the corresponding row will appear in the other image.

## 8.6 - Disparity Map 
Use the class `StereoBM` and the function that implements a block matching technique (template matching will be explored later within this Computer Vision course) to find correspondences over two rectified stereo images. Use the parameters specified as follow since we will not enter in details of these functions. Be careful to use gray level rectified images for the correspondence algorithm. You might modify the Stereo Matching parameters or even try other methods (for example `StereoSGBM_create`). 
Note: you need to perform a conversion to an 8 bits grey level image to display the disparity map.
```html
# Call the constructor for StereoBM
stereo = cv2.StereoBM_create(numDisparities=16*5, blockSize=21)

# Calculate the disparity image
disparity = stereo.compute(remap_imgl,remap_imgr)

# -- Display  as a CV_8UC1 image
disparity = cv2.normalize(src=disparity, dst=disparity, beta=0, alpha=255, norm_type=cv2.NORM_MINMAX);
disparity = np.uint8(disparity)

cv2.imshow("left", left)
cv2.imshow('Disparity Map', disparity)
cv2.waitKey()
```

## 8.7 - 3D Reconstruction
Use the function cvReprojectImageTo3D to compute the 3D coordinates of the pixels in the disparity map. The parameters of cvReprojectImageTo3D are the disparity map (`disp` in previous exercise), and the matrix Q given by the function `cvStereoRectify`. Save the 3D coordinates in a npz file.

## Open3D installation (homework)
We will use `open3CD` as well as `openCV` in the next labs. You should have a tutorial example running on your computer. Install open3D as explained in:
http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/getting_started.html 
Check if the installation is up and running by running some tutorials on the same page.
Be careful since Open3D only support python version up to 3.11 and numpy version previous to 2.0.
